latency: time consumption for clustering
memory: Peak memory consumption for clustering
LCP: the average overlap between each point k nearest neighbors in the entire and clustering spaces
Entropy: the degree of balance, computed from the distribution of sizes across all clusters

Note that when the clustering is highly unbalanced, i.e., the entropy approaches 0, the computation of LCP becomes meaningless.
